# VKprop: a Voight-Kampff styled prop for a Blade Runner-themed TTRPG

I am completely new to the world og TTRPGs, but a huge fan of the movie Blade Runner. So when the Blade Runner TTRPG was announced to much fanfare on Kickstarter, I was all in. As I began to learn about the game, I thought there might be some fun things I could do with electronics and code to augment the gameplay and add to the overall user experience. I decided on an electronic and interactive prop that could be used to move the game along or perform certain tasks, like a Voight-Kampff test, or rolling die. I wanted this prop to live inside an enclosure that looks like a VK machine, but also a shape simple enough to 3D print. And finally, I wanted it to have a little bit of an "Oh Wow!" factor, so I had to include some cool lights, sounds and graphics too.
